I'm not going out tonight 'cause I don't want to go
I am staying home tonight 'cause I don't want to know
You revealed the world to me, and I would never be
Dwelling in such happiness, your gift of purity

I don't pay attention to the ones who never cared
Find your own direction 'cause there's sweetness in the air
You will be the world to me, and I will always be
Dwelling in this happiness, your gift of purity
